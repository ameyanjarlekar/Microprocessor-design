## Comments

1. Only forwarding and stalls used to handle hazards
2. PC+1 of the instruction (in the write-back stage) is stored in R7
3. Forwarding of PC value to R7 isn't implemented
4. Z-flag is not set by LW instruction
5. Writing into R7 doesn't change the control-flow

## Files

1. datapath_v2.pdf contains the diagram of datapath
2. datapath.ods contains the description of datapath
3. forwarding_logic.ods describes the forwarding mechanism implemented
